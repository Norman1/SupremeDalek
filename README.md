warlight bot for theaigames.com

This is the version of the bot that won 3rd place in the finals.

If you want to use the bot, perhaps even on a different map than the small earth map, be aware of following issues:
- Some hardcoded stuff like picking the starting regions.
- The bot lacks a central strategy component. This leads to expansion and fighting being very loosely connected to each other. Connecting those tasks in a more meaningfull way needs some fundamental refactoring.
